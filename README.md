P2P-Streams XBMC Addon
================

About the addon
----------
p2p-streams is an XBMC addon for watching peer-to-peer streams in XBMC without the need for external players. Peer-to-peer (P2P) computing or networking is a distributed application architecture that partitions tasks or workloads between peers. Peers are equally privileged, equipotent participants in the application. They are said to form a peer-to-peer network of nodes.

The addon currently supports SopCast and AceStream and several platforms:
* Windows
* OSX
* Android
* Linux
  * Armv6 (Raspberry PI including OpenELEC)
  * Armv7 (OpenELEC,Xbian,MXLinux)
  * i386 (including OpenELEC)
  * x86_64 (including OpenELEC)
